# Bakery Web Page for Cardanni


Made Typescript, React and react-router to handle routes/pages.

- landing page using a carrousel to offer events, promos, etc.
- Menu page with an interesting desing, right now is using https://picsum.photos/200 to get random pictures.
- Contact page with a form that after submit sends a custom message via whatsapp.
- Working cart using useReducer to control the state. After the user clicks the "hacer pedido" button, the component is gonna create a message with the cart items and send it via whatsapp.
